# html notes

## use of `<a href="#">`
Regarding the nav demo and the use of `<a href="#">`  Possibly they are saying its
just a stub.  See this url here for more info. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4855168/what-is-href-and-why-is-it-used

Here I have replaced all but one of these with the better stub and some sample pages.
I wonder though if I could include this file in the other files?
```
            <li><a href="home.html">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="javascript:void(0);">Blog</a></li>
            <li><a href="javascript:void(0);">Meetings</a></li>
            <li><a href="javascript:void(0);">Privacy</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
```
