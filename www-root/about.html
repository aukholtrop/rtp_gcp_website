<p>
rtp-gcp.org is a user group started in 2018.  The GDG name is GDG Cloud RTP.  Each week we have a 
one to two hour workshop.  During these workshop we 
<ul>
<li>sometimes just chat</li>
<li>work on projects</li>
<li>free labs provided by Google/Qwiklabs or AWS</li>
<li>periodically we participate in Google campaigns such as DevFests, StudyJams or Fireside Chats.<li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For more info about our meetings visit the official GDG page <a href="https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-rtp">here</a></p>

<p>We also act as an aws user group. I just reuse the same domain and slack.  As an after thought, I probably should simply formed a rtp-cloud user group.  Who knows perhaps I will do an Azure/IBM bluemix(or whatever its called)in the future. TODO: I have registered a domain, created a github, move all aws references to there.</p>

<p>This website is hosted on GCP as a static website.  Since I am funding this myself, I am trying to find the cheapest solution. 
If you know of a cheaper alternative on GCP please let me know. </p>



<p>Disclaimer: GDG Cloud RTP is an independent group; our activities and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google, the corporation. To learn more about the GDG program, visit https://developers.google.com/community/gdg/ </p>
